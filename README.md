Medapp
The purpose is to manage the patient information. 
It can edit,add and delete patient infromation. And it can edit the doctor's information as well.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.3.
We are going to use Mysql to edit the database.

Components
Patients
Patients detials
app.component
doctors setting(not import)
patient search(not achieve)
login（not achieve）

we use the router to navigate the different components.
we use the service to fetch or save data directly rather than components. And the component is only for the display.
for the test, we are going to use Jasmine to test the app which includes component test and dashboard.But now, we don’t have knowledge about that
